  Hello
  = "#{@account.first_name}!"

%p
  We received a request to change your Dreamgram password. You can do this by clicking
  - reset_link = link_to 'this link', edit_account_password_url(:reset_password_token => @token)
  = "#{reset_link}."

%p
  If you did not request a password reset, ignore this email. Your password will not change unless you create a new
one.
