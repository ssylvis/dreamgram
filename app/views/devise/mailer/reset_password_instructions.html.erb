<p>Hello <%= @user.name %>!</p>

<p>We received a request to change your password on Dreamgram. You can do this by clicking on the following link:<br/>
<%= link_to nil, edit_user_password_url(:reset_password_token => @token) %>.</p>

<p>If you did not request your password reset, you can simply ignore this email. Your password will not change until
you create a new one.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Dreamgram</p>
