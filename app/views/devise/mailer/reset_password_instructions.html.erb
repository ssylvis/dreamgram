<p>Hello <%= @account.name %>!</p>

<p>We received a request to change your password on Dreamgram. You can do this by clicking:
<%= link_to 'this link', edit_account_password_url(:reset_password_token => @token) %>.</p>

<p>If you did not request your password reset, you can simply ignore this email. Your password will not change unless
you create a new one.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Dreamgram</p>
